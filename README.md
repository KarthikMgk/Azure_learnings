# Getting Started with Azure ML Studio

I'm documenting all the experiments which I had carried out using Azure ML Studio as a part of getting used to performing machine learning in an environment like Azure ML Studio. Like everyone, I have been using Jupyter notebook to learn ML and DL. I was curious to know about various platforms through which we can try out ML and that's how I found Azure ML Studio.

The experiments are begineer friendly. It has decent amount of documentation and I have intentionally avoided explanation for hyperparameters and their tuning to keep it brief. Hope you like it. 

I strongly encourage you to use python environment as these Drag and Drop environment can dumb down your learning and can certainly make you lazy especially if you are a beginner.
